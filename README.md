Estimation of LAI with a Comparative Analysis for Yield Prediction for Rice and Maize

Introduction

This project focuses on developing a cost-effective system for crop yield prediction using RGB aerial imagery.
By integrating:
	•	Deep learning for crop classification,
	•	Vegetation indices for Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation, and
	•	Historical data to correlate LAI with yield,

we aim to target rice and maize crops specifically. This project simplifies yield estimation, addresses the limitations of traditional methods, and offers an accessible, scalable solution to support precision agriculture and sustainable food production.

Motivation

Agriculture faces significant challenges due to the lack of accessible and efficient crop health estimation and yield prediction systems. Existing solutions are often:
	•	Time-consuming,
	•	Expensive, or
	•	Dependent on specialized equipment.

This project fills this gap by leveraging deep learning and RGB aerial imagery to estimate Leaf Area Index (LAI) and predict crop yield.
Focusing on rice and maize offers a scalable, cost-effective solution that simplifies yield estimation and supports data-driven agricultural decisions.

Objective
	1.	Estimate Leaf Area Index (LAI) from RGB imagery using vegetation indices.
	2.	Correlate LAI with yield using production data from secondary datasets.
	3.	Predict crop yield for target images based on calculated LAI.
	4.	Provide a scalable, cost-effective tool for precision agriculture.

Methodology

Our approach involves the following key steps:
	1.	Crop Classification
	•	RGB aerial images are processed using a pre-trained VGG model to classify crop types (focusing on rice and maize).
	2.	LAI Estimation
	•	Leaf Area Index (LAI) is estimated from classified crop images using vegetation indices derived from RGB imagery.
	3.	Yield Prediction
	•	Historical production data is used to correlate the estimated LAI with crop yield.
	•	Reference images with known LAI and yield are analyzed to establish a mapping.
	4.	Target Prediction
	•	The established LAI-yield relationship is applied to target images to predict crop yield.
	5.	Comparative Analysis
	•	Results are compared and validated to ensure the reliability of the predictions.

This methodology combines deep learning and vegetation analysis to deliver a scalable and cost-effective crop monitoring and yield prediction solution.

Existing Results

Strengths of Existing Systems
	•	Accurate Vegetation Monitoring: Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems excel in monitoring crop health and estimating LAI.
	•	Yield Prediction: These systems can correlate LAI data with historical yield records to optimize agricultural practices.

Challenges with Existing Systems
	•	High Cost: Specialized sensors and equipment are expensive, limiting accessibility for small-scale farmers.
	•	Complex Data Processing: Sophisticated data processing and expertise are required, making these systems less user-friendly.

Key Features
	•	Deep Learning Models: Use of pre-trained VGG models for robust crop classification.
	•	Cost-Effective Tools: RGB imagery eliminates the need for expensive multispectral/hyperspectral sensors.
	•	Scalable Solution: Designed to be accessible for farmers and agricultural researchers worldwide.

Conclusion

This project offers a practical and innovative approach to crop monitoring and yield prediction. By addressing cost and accessibility challenges, it has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture and support sustainable food production.
